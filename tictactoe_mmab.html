			<h4>Quick Aside</h4>
			<div class = "aside">
			<p>
			I first learned of Tic Tac Toe in my grandfather's copy of Scientific American in the 'Mathematical Games' monthly column written by the now late 
			Martin Gardner. Martin, though not a mathematician himself, worked with mathematicians, philosophers and scientists to reveal the wonderful world
			of recreational mathematics and logic to the masses (and one young quadrupled-eyed keener). Topics like Conways Game of Life, Tower of Hanoi and Hexaflexagons
			became part of the vernacular and experiments of many a young thinker across generations. Martin's work inspired others such as Douglas Hofstadter, 
			Shakuntala Devi, Steven Strogratz in the New York Times and even a slew of mathy YouTubers. The explanation of these few experiments in games, math and 
			logic serve, however insignificant, to honour Martin Gardner's contributions, influence and to carry on a task he started over five decades ago.
			</p>
			</div>	
			<h2>Problem</h2>
			<p>
			Create a perfect player such that every Tic Tac Toe (TTT) ends in a draw or a win regardless of which player starts.
			</p>
			<h2>Solution</h2>
			<p>
			TTT is a two-person zero-sum game (a game such that each player's gain / loss utility is balanced by the other's loss / gain) with perfect information 
			(since players play in turn neither player has an information advantage over the other), which lends itself to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax#Minimax_algorithm_with_alternate_moves" target="_blank">minimax</a> decision rule strategy. 
			</p>
			<p>
			The minimax decision rule for the perfect player works by aiming to minimize the maximum payoff possible for the other player. This payoff is calculated by a heuristic
			evaluation (<code>function scoreCalc()</code>) that calculates the winning state of a board. The minimax can be thought of as exploring the nodes of a 
			game tree, traversing the possible different configurations of the board. This makes minimax a rather tedious algorithm working in exponential time 
			complexity (related to how the number of branches and depth of the tree) and linear space complexity. 
			</p>
			<p>
			It can be optimized by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning" target="_blank">alpha-beta pruning</a> search algorithm that seeks
			to seeks to decrease the number of evaluated nodes by maintaining two values <code>alpha (α)</code> and <code>beta (β)</code>, which represents the maximum payoff assured 
			to the perfect player and the minimum payoff assured to the other, respectively. This allows us to avoid certain nodes in the game tree where <code>α</code> > <code>β</code>. 
			</p>
			<p>
			The pseudocode used in the <code>function alphaBetaMM()</code> is provided below:
			</p>
			<div class = "pseudo">
				<pre>
01 <b>function</b> alphaBetaMM(depth, α, β, maxPlayer, turns)
02    calculate all possible next moves
03    <b>if</b> terminal node (i.e. next move ends the game) or depth = 0
04        value = heuristic value of that node from scoreCalc(turns)
05        <b>return</b> the heuristic value of that node
06    <b>else</b>
07        <b>for</b> each child of node (i.e. for each next move)
08            <b>if</b> maxPlayer
09                value := alphaBetaMM(depth - 1,α, β, minPlayer,turns)
10                α = max(α, value)
11                value = α
12            <b>else</b>
13                value := alphaBetaMM(depth - 1,α, β, maxPlayer,turns)
14                β = min(β, value)
15                value = β
16            <b>if</b> β ≤ α
17                <b>break</b>
18    <b>return</b> value;
					</pre>
				</div>
				<h2>Concluding Thoughts</h2>
				<p>
				The Tic Tac Toe alpha-beta minimax solution is not a difficult solution but will serve us well as we look to explore game solutions for more interesting games (Othello, Mancala etc). 
				That said TTT can be made quite interesting by adding additional dimensions (or even a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tic-tac-toe" target="_blank">quantum twist</a>).
				In his Scientific American Tic Tac Toe piece, Gardner shows how these additions can make even this age old game non-trivial:
				</p>
				<blockquote>
				"A truly master player, robot or human, would not only know the most probably responses of novices, as determined by statistical studies of past games; he would also analyze each 
				opponent's style of play to determine what sort of mistakes the opponent would most likely make. If the novice improved as he played, this too would have to be considered. At this point
				the humble game of tic tac toe plunges us into far from trivial questions of probability and psychology."
				<p>
				Scientific American, March 1957
